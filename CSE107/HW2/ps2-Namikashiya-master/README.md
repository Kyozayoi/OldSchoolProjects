This repository contains homework 2 of CSE 107 at UCSD in Fall 2017.  
The assignment is due on Monday October 16th, 2017 at 11:59 PM.  
Submission for this assignment is electronic through Github and is detailed below.  


# Getting Started
To get started clone this repository and the crypto repository:

    git clone https://github.com/CSE107-Fall2017/*.git
    
where * is the name of your repository.

You should also update your crypto repository by navigating to it and using:

    git pull

You can then run the python file by navigating into the local PS2 directory and running 

    python problem_1.py
    

# problem_1.py
This python file contains question 1.  
It is on PRFs.

# Turn in Procedure

2) Make sure your code runs.
3) Make sure you have filled out the student_info.json file with the appropriate information.
4) Make sure you have commited any changes with
    
    git commit -am "blah"
    
    where blah can be replace with any message you want.
5) Push you changes with

6) Celebrate.

At the time of deadline, we will take a snapshot of your repository and grade off of those python files.  

# Documentation on crypto Library
If you have any questions or problems using the crypto library, 
please consult https://avivkiss.github.io/cs107-w16/intro.html for documentation.
The "Conventions" and "Tools" sections are probably the most useful for your purposes. 
Please ignore the "Getting Started" section on that website, and instead consult the "Getting Started" section above. Please also note that the links to piazza and email are for past years
and therefore wrong.
