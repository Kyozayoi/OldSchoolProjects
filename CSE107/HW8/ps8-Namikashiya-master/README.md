This repository contains Assignment 8 of CSE 107 at UCSD in Fall 2017.  
### The assignment is due on Wednesday, November 29, 2017 at 11:59 PM.  
Submission for this assignment is electronic through Github and is detailed below.  


# Getting Started
To get started clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/CSE107-Fall2017/*.git

where * is the name of your repository.

### Note: You should also update your crypto repository by navigating to it and using:

    git pull

Make sure to follow the setup instructions in the README's from the earlier assignments first. (Specifically downloading the crypto folder and installing pycrypto.)

You can then run each python file by navigating into the local PS8 directory and running

    python question_#.py

To edit or add your local files to Github, you can either use git via command line or upload manually in your repository.  

# question_1.py
This python file contains the code for question 1 in the assignment.  
It deals with the material on one-wayness.  

# question_2.py
This python file contains the code for question 2 in the assignment.  
It deals with the material on digital signature schemes.  

# Turn in Procedure
1) Make sure your code and text answers are in the indicated section of both files.  
2) Make sure your code runs.
3) Make sure you have filled out the student_info.json file with the appropriate information.
4) Make sure you have committed any changes with

    git commit -m "blah"

    where blah can be replaced with any message you want.
5) Push your changes with

    git push
6) Celebrate.

At the time of the deadline, we will take a snapshot of your repository and grade off of those python files.
