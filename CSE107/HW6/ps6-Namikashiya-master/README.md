# PS6
This repository contains Assignment 6 of CSE 107 at UCSD in Fall 2017.  
The assignment is due on Monday, November 6st, 2017 at 11:59 PM.  
Submission for this assignment is electronic through Github and is detailed below.  


# Getting Started
To get started clone this repository and the crypto repository:

    git clone https://github.com/CSE107-Fall2017/*.git

where * is the name of your repository.
Make sure to follow the setup instructions in the README's from the earlier assignments first. (Specifically downloading the crypto folder and installing pycrypto.)

You can then run each python file by navigating into the local PS6 directory and running

    python problem_#.py

# problem_1.py
This python file contains the code for question 1 in the assignment.  
It deals with material on authenticated encryption.

# Turn in Procedure
1) Make sure your code and text answers are in the indicated section of both files.  
2) Make sure your code runs.
3) Make sure you have filled out the student_info.json file with the appropriate information.
4) Make sure you have committed any changes with

    git commit -m "blah"

    where blah can be replaced with any message you want.
5) Push your changes with

    git push
6) Celebrate.

At the time of the deadline, we will take a snapshot of your repository and grade off of those python files.
